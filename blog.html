                In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const. In this article, we will see the differences between the var, let, and const keywords. We will discuss the scope and other required concepts about each keyword. <br> <br>

                var keyword in JavaScript:  Earlier only var is there and he is the king of variable declarations. But there are some issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why let and const introduced. <br>

                Var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped. That means if a variable is declared with var outside a function then it is in the global scope(accessible anywhere). Otherwise, if they are inside a function we can only access them inside the function.
                Problems with the var keyword <br>

                One of the issues with the var keyword is they can be re-declared inside the same scope. And another issue with var is these variables are not blocked scope which means if var is declared within any {}(block statements), they are not scoped to that block but to the entire global scope. <br>

                Let 
                <br>
                It’s an enhanced version of var, it solves all the problems that come with the var keyword. Like, let is a block-scoped variable and we cannot re-declared but can be updated(re-assigned). You’ll see in the below example as it shows that let is preferable over var. <br>

                const <br>

                Const declarations share some similarities with let declarations, but const variables cannot be updated or re-declared. It maintains the constant values.
                Unlike var and let, if we are using const then it must be initialized at the same time when we declared the variable.

              <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
